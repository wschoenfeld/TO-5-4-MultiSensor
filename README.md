# TO-5-4-MultiSensor
I really like the look of those old TO-5 packages so I wanted to create a multi-sensor package that could fit inside one of them. I decided that it can have 4 different I2C sensors on it. A temperature sensor (MAX31875), an accelerometer (BMA530), a magnetometer (MMC5633NJL) and a humidity/temperature sensor (SHT40).
